  <h2>Fizzy Drink Addictions</h2>
<p> 
Addiction is a mental and physiological disorder characterized by the continued use of a substance even though it affects you negatively.

People can become addicted to a variety of substances and behaviors, including drugs, prescription medications, sex, and smartphone usage.

However, soda addiction doesn’t have an official definition, and there’s currently not enough evidence to suggest that it’s a true disorder.

Soda addiction, or dependence on soda, can be defined as drinking excessive amounts of soda without being able to quit or moderate your intake — even if you experience negative effects.

Food addictions — including soda addiction — can have many behaviors in common with drug addiction.

Because soda contains several potentially habit-forming substances like caffeine, sodium, and sugar or artificial sweeteners, it’s easier to become dependent on soda than you might think
